Perfect‚Äîgoing **black and white** creates a **striking, timeless, and highly professional aesthetic**. Here's the revised plan incorporating a **black-and-white theme** along with your original requirements and 3D structure elements.

---

## üñ§ AI Agent Entrepreneurship Framework Website Plan

**Theme:** Minimalist, Black & White, 3D-enhanced
**Style Keywords:** Clean ‚Ä¢ Futuristic ‚Ä¢ High-contrast ‚Ä¢ Technical elegance

---

### 1. üß© **Website Style**

**Minimalist with 3D depth**

* **Visual Style:** Black background, white foreground elements, subtle grayscale gradients for depth.
* **3D Structure:** Use **white wireframe 3D models** (e.g., nodes, orbits, cubes) against a black canvas.
* **Aesthetic:** Think Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúPro‚Äù branding meets a startup tech lab‚Äîlaser-focused and data-driven.

### 4. üß† **Visual & 3D Elements**

#### ‚úîÔ∏è Visuals to Include:

* **3D Rotatable Framework Wheel**

  * Each layer of the AI agent lifecycle shown as concentric circles or orbiting rings
* **Industry Opportunity Map**

  * Matrix of sectors as 3D wireframe cubes or tiles
* **Flow Diagrams**

  * Step-by-step logic using white flow lines and animated path transitions

#### ‚ú® Tools to Consider:

* **Three.js** or **Spline** for 3D structure
