## 5. ROI Calculation Templates

### General AI Agent ROI Formula
```
ROI = (Value Generated - Total Cost) / Total Cost × 100%
```

Where:
- **Value Generated** = Direct Revenue + Cost Savings + Productivity Gains
- **Total Cost** = Licensing Fees + Implementation Costs + Operational Costs

### Industry-Specific ROI Calculators

#### Customer Service Agent ROI
```
Annual Value = (Avg Resolution Time Saved × Hourly Agent Cost × Annual Volume) + (Improved CSAT × Customer Lifetime Value × Customer Base × Retention Impact)

ROI = (Annual Value - Annual AI Cost) / Annual AI Cost × 100%
```

#### Sales Agent ROI
```
Annual Value = (Lead Conversion Improvement × Average Deal Size × Annual Lead Volume) + (Sales Cycle Reduction × Deal Probability Increase × Pipeline Value)

ROI = (Annual Value - Annual AI Cost) / Annual AI Cost × 100%
```

#### Manufacturing Agent ROI
```
Annual Value = (Downtime Reduction × Hourly Production Value) + (Quality Improvement × Defect Cost Reduction) + (Resource Optimization × Resource Cost)

ROI = (Annual Value - Annual AI Cost) / Annual AI Cost × 100%
```
